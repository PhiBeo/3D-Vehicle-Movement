# 3D-Vehicle-Movement

A Unity project demonstrating a physics-based 3D vehicle system using Wheel Colliders. This project provides a basic but expandable framework for car movement, steering, braking, and suspension in a realistic environment.

## Features

- ✅ Physics-based vehicle movement using Unity's `WheelCollider`
- ✅ Working suspension system with adjustable spring/damper settings
- ✅ Motor, steering, and braking controls
- ✅ Visual wheel mesh alignment to match collider rotation
- ✅ Simple terrain for testing vehicle dynamics
- ✅ Modular code for easy extension (e.g. add new vehicle types)

## Prerequisite

- Unity 6000.0.45f1

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PhiBeo/3D-Vehicle-Movement.git


## Timeline (6 weeks)
- Week 1: 
  - Functional moving vehicle with adjustable motor force, brake, and steer
  - The vehicle works, but the mass of the rigid body, motor force and friction need to be adjusted to prevent the vehicle from flipping over
  - Need to add more features to the main script, and make it easier to adjust the value of individual wheels and the main component.
